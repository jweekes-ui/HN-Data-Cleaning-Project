# HN-Data-Cleaning-Project
This is a simple introductory project to data cleaning workflows in basic python.

In this dataset which is sourced from the Hacker News website, we're specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either "Ask HN" or  "Show HN". Users submit the `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question whilst they use the `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product or just something interesting.

In this Analysis Project we want to compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

**1)** Which between the `Ask HN` or `Show HN` posts receive more comments on average?
**2)** Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
